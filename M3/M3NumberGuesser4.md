<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I was able to create the higher and lower hint by implementing it<br>where the code returned text that either the guess was wrong or right.<br>Since the hint should only appear when they are wrong I put it<br>under the code where it would be wrong. In that code, I added<br>a simple if else statement. The statement checked if the guess was greater<br>than the correct number. If so then it would say &quot;lower&quot; and if<br>it wasn&#39;t then it would move onto the else statement where it would<br>say &quot;lower&quot;.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>Shows my second implementation which was the hot/cold hint that appears in order<br>to help the user know if they are close or far away from<br>the correct number. It can be seen working in the terminal at the<br>bottom.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For the hot warm hot indicator, I was able to follow a similar<br>path to what I did for the higher lower hint that I did<br>first. Since this would only apply if the user was wrong I put<br>it under the code that would return if the user guessed the number<br>wrong. I made a variable that stores the difference between the guess and<br>the actual answer. If the guess met certain criteria in terms of how<br>far off it was from the actual number then it would return either<br>hot warm or cold. This was done using an if-else statement. With the<br>if-else statement, it would go down the list of if-else&#39;s and whichever criteria<br>was met first then it would run that. I did run into an<br>issue which was that it wasn&#39;t working at first because I did not<br>have Math.abs. Without Math.abs it wouldn&#39;t read the difference value correctly and would<br>not return any of the intended outputs.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I was able to learn about the importance of placement within code. I<br>first tried to implement my ideas in a couple of places all of<br>which wasn&#39;t working well and wouldn&#39;t work when they should have. I was<br>finally able to find the right spot and made it work. I also<br>tried implementing the level difficulty idea but I struggled with it and was<br>able to create the cases along with the correct number of strikes but<br>an issue persisted and made it so that I wasn&#39;t able to figure<br>it out. I then did the hot warm cold hint which followed a<br>very similar path to the higher lower. That worked well and I was<br>able to complete that. The only other issue I had was with pushing<br>and pulling but Prof. Toegel was able to help me because I forgot<br>to put my work in a new branch instead of the previous HW&#39;s<br>branch.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
